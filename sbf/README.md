# Universal SongBook Format

The need for a versatile song-along and play-along songbook brings a need for
an universal format, available for simple machine processing allowing more features
than a simple songbook display.

## Planned features

* keep TeX output possibility
* unfolding chorus portions to avoid upscrolling
* autoscroll based on rhythm
* metronome and song position auto-indication
* synchronized song-along with multiple instances
* inline display of tabulatures, melody lines or intermezzos

## Structure

Universal SongBook Format is a container described by YANG, thus freely
convertible between JSON, XML and CBOR.
